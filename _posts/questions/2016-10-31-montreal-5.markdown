The Rules restricted greywater use because in previous SD competitions the houses were built on a parking lot or green lawn temporarily. The houses had closed systems and no greywater was allowed to go on the ground (for protection of the site). However, this time we have connected water systems and permanent landscaping in the competition village, so please follow the Building Code which allows more uses for greywater and rainwater.
