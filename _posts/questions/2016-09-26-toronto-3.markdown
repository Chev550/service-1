There is no requirement or limitation for an elevator. Teams have freedom to consider this issue based on your own design.

According to the America Disability Act (ADA), elevators are not required in facilities that are less than three stories or that have less than 3000 square feet per story unless the building is a shopping center, a shopping mall, or the professional office of a health care provider, or another type of facility as determined by the Attorney General.
