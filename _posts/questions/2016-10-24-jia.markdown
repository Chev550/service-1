Here is the missing information:

- The wind load for Dezhou shall be taken as `0.45kN/m2`, which is the basic wind pressure with the recurrence rate of 50 years (at 10m above the ground, 10-minute average annual maximum wind speed is about `26.86m/s`).
- When it is predicted that the wind velocity may exceed `26.86m/s`, a notice for forcible withdrawal (evacuation order) will be issued.
- In Dezhou, the earthquake-resistant fortification intensity is `7`, and the design basic acceleration is `0.10g`.
- In Dezhou, the snow load shall be `0.35kN/m2`, and the coefficient division of quasi-permanent value for snow load shall be `II`.
