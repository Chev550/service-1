Yes, Contest 10.2 is the final rule. There will be some updates about event schedules (Appendix A-2, A-3) in future, but Section III Contest Criteria will no longer be updated for SDC 2017.

We do realize that Contest 10.2 will restrict the variety of PV application. Therefore, we granted only 20 available points for this subcontest.

Contest 10.2 is intended to encourage high efficiency and reasonable installation of PV system.
