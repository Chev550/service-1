Unfortunately, the power supply of 240V, 60Hz is not allowed in the competition. According to the Building Code, there are two power distribution systems available. Teams can select either one:

1. The three-phase power supply has the voltage of ~220/380V and frequency of 50Hz.
2. The single-phase power supply has the voltage of ~220V and frequency of 50Hz.

The short-circuit current at the inlet is considered as 6kA. Please accordingly adjust your design to meet this requirement.
