Teams shall complete `40` kilometers driving in no more than `60` minutes, `four` times during the contest week, to qualify for points. Electrical energy consumed for the task will be measured at the charging piles. All available points are earned by the team that consumes the least electricity to finish the driving task. Other teams will be scored proportionally based on the electricity consumption.
