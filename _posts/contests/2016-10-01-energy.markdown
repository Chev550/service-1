__10-1. Energy Balance__ (80 points)

All available points are earned at the conclusion of the specified energy performance period for a net electrical energy balance of at least `0 kWh`. A positive net electrical energy balance indicates net production; a negative net electrical energy balance indicates net consumption. Reduced points are earned for a net electrical energy balance between -50 kWh and 0 kWh. Reduced points are scaled linearly.

__10-2. Generating Capacity__ (20 points)

Generating capacity will be determined at the conclusion of the specified energy performance period by calculating the measured energy production per unit PV area (kWh/m2). All available points are earned by the team that has the highest generating capacity. Other teams will be scored proportionally.
