	<p>Amaravati, the People's capital of Andhra Pradesh, is envisioned to be a city at par with world-class standards, with a vision of increasing Andhra Pradesh’s, and India’s prominence in the world. Planning affordable and sustainable housing solutions and making them available will shape the city and its neighborhoods. At Amaravati we have opportunity to develop new housing typologies, lifestyle for future citizens by amalgamating our beliefs and ideologies with sustainable approach for healthy, environment friendly and improved living conditions.</p>

	<p>Culture, Climate and Technology form the 3 main pillars of Project Solarise. The Indian culture has never been rigid and that's why it has evolved and is still surviving with pride in the modern era as well. The project Solarise by Team Shunya will portray the Indian culture’s willingness to adapt, change and strive for improvement. For the modern Indians living in the city, Project Solarise will provide more living space and the modern facilities at disposal. Contemporary model in creating a smart housing community is inspired from learning from regional architectural designs. Throw in a bit of customization, urban farming and careful planning of the energy generation-consumption equation and you have a perfect recipe for healthy, sustainable and ecofriendly living.</p>

	<p>As Amravati is a Greenfield project, it is a land of immense opportunities and unprecedented possibilities. Design focuses on providing housing with minimal reduction of existing green area. This is achieved by using vertical stacking and providing gardens at each level. These gardens can be used as balcony farms or patios. They would also provide natural shading thus decreasing the heat gain from sun and saving considerable amount of energy spent in cooling the house.</p>

	<p>Based on four basic elements, viz., central service core, functional spaces, semi-open spaces and protective facade, each house is designed to provide optimal combination of functionality, accessibility, entertainment and security. A personalized veranda and wrapping envelope is designed to protect the structure from harsh sun rays and torrential rain. The buffer envelop will also help in keeping the interiors of the house cool. Windows and open-able fenestrations along with the use of jaali Architecture will provide for cross ventilation and maximum internal illumination, thus, saving electricity and energy—making Project Solarise an environment friendly and sustainable housing structure.</p>

	<p>Project Solarise will be a model for urban housing planning in new cities like Amravati that are on the precipice of innovation. A sustainable housing model being essential to India, Team Shunya focuses on a fusion of ancient architectural principles that have been successfully implemented and new concepts that make human living more sustainable, healthy and eco-friendly. Addressing India's urban housing demand and aspiration of young India, through Project Solarise Team Shunya will design an ideal house which would combine a uniform design template with room for interpretation so that each individual homeowner can make their home unique. Project Solarize focuses on providing comfort and convenience to owners at all stages of their lives. In this way, they will become long-term residents and plant their roots in the city  thus contributing to the city’s economy and wider cultural network of businesses, schools and government. This house would be a dream housing option for the people who eye long term solutions in energy efficiency and smart housing solutions. The house by the virtue of its modularity and adaptability would cater to a wide section of customers.</p>

	<p>阿玛拉瓦蒂是安德拉邦的首府，它被设想成一个具有世界级标准的、能够提高安德拉邦和印度在世界上的地位的城市。规划一个可负担并且可持续的住宅解决方案并且让它具有可实施性可以塑造城市及其邻里。在阿玛拉瓦蒂，我们有机会通过针对健康、环境友好、改善生活质量的可持续手段，结合我们的信念和意识形态为未来的市民开发新的住房类型和生活方式。</p>

	<p>文化、气候和科技形成了Solarise项目的三大支柱，印度文化从来没有僵化，这就是为什么它曾演变过，并且在当下依然可以以一种自豪感存在着。Shunya团队的Solarise项目将会阐述印度文化为了改进的意愿所做的适应、改变和努力。对于居住在城市中的现代印度人，Solarise项目会提供更多的居住空间和现代化的设施。当代对于设计智能住宅社区的模型，是在学习局部建筑设计中得到启发的。投入一些专业化定制、城市农业和有关能源消耗方程的详细规划，就可以得到一个关于健康、可持续和环保生活的完美方案。</p>

	<p>由于阿玛拉瓦蒂是一个绿地项目，它是一块有着巨大的机会和史无前例的可能性的土地。项目的重点是在最小化减少现有绿地的条件下提供住宅，可以通过采用垂直堆叠并在每一层提供花园来实现，这些花园可以用作阳台农场或者露台，它们还将提供自然遮挡以此来减少来自太阳的热量并且节省用在为房屋提供冷气上的大量能源。</p>

	<p>基于四种基本元素，即中心服务核心，功能空间，半开放空间和保护性立面，每一间房子都会被设计为具有功能性、可访问性、娱乐性和安全性的最佳组合。个性化的阳台和装饰用的围合的设计可以保护结构免受太阳直射和暴雨的侵蚀。起缓冲作用的围合部分还可以使建筑的内部空间保持凉爽。窗口和可开启式的窗扇以及jaali建筑的应用可以为室内提供交叉通风和内部照明的最大化。因此，节省电力和能源——使Solarise项目成为一个环境友好型和可持续型的住宅。</p>

	<p>Solarise项目将会成为一些像阿玛拉瓦蒂这样的新城市的都市住宅规划典范，这些城市正处于创新的边缘。一个可持续住宅模型对于印度来说是至关重要的。Shunya团队关注于将已经被成功实施的古老建筑规则和可以让人类生活得更加可持续、更加健康和更加环保的新概念融合起来。为了解决印度城市的住宅需求以及满足青年人的愿景，Shunya团队将通过Solarise项目设计一个理想住宅，它将统一的设计模板和对空间的阐释相结合，使每一个房主可以让他们住宅独一无二。Solarise项目致力于为每一个人生阶段的业主提供舒适和便利，这样，他们将逐渐成为长期居民，在城市扎根，从而为城市的经济和企业，学校和政府的更广泛的文化网作出贡献。这个住宅将成为那些着眼于高效节能和智能住宅方案的长远型策略的人的理想住宅选择，该住宅将凭借它的模块化和适应性去迎合更多的用户。</p>
