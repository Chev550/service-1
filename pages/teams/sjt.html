	<p>Team SJTUIUC target is mainly focused on "The left-behind families" in Chinese villages upon the background of rapid urbanization. Under the policy of China's new rural construction, our objective is to solve those social problems which are highlighted in rural areas, such as low-income farmers, left-behind children, empty nesters and idle houses, etc. Beyond of that, we also strive to provide solutions for better ecological rural tourism and the new urbanization community.</p>

	<p>Based on our detailed and persuasive market research, we defined our direction of market promotion. We put Dezhou’s villages as prototypes, set the goal of exploring the future ways of living and the status of new countryside and try to solve the widespread problems in rural areas: The Cyclical changes in the using way of rural house - "two generations" - "three generations" - "two generations".</p>

	<p>("two generations" - Old people and children stay at home, young people go out to make a living, idle rooms can be used for accommodation; "three generations" - On harvest season or festivals, young people return and families reunion.)</p>

	<p>Therefore, we put forward the concept of "V-bnb" as a solution to the cyclical change of house using way. "bnb" is the same as "b&b" which originally means bed and breakfast provided for people who need a convenient accommodation. Since "bnb" has become extensively popular in China, especially in rural area and has also become one kind of way for villagers to increase income under the policy of developing ecotourism village. Therefore, we choose the “bnb” as an idea and direction in the developing of our house. Regarding for "V", it means three kinds of relationship of the house: it's for Villagers (to increase income), it's for Visiting (by neighbors or visitors, it's a start point of turning the state of houses from completely private to semi private and semi public) and it's for Vacation (for city people who need an ecotourism to experience the rural life).</p>

	<p>This is our V-bnb.</p>

	<p>Team SJTUIUC基于中国新农村建设大背景，着眼于解决农村中较为凸显的社会问题，包括农民经济水平落后，留守儿童、孤寡老人现象，房屋闲置以及迎合新农村规划中的生态旅游和新型社区的解决方案等问题。</p>

	<p>Team SJTUIUC以德州市待转型开发的百余农村为原型，以发展未来新农村、探索未来居住方式为目标，以解决农村中普遍存在的“隔代居”——“三代居”——“隔代居”的房屋使用情况为理念，以单体构建未来新型社区为方向，并引入“民宿（bnb）”的概念以适应农民房屋用途的周期性变化，通过该商业形式迎合农民经济增收的基本需求。</p>

	<p>“隔代居”：留守老人和孩子，成年人外出务工，部分房屋空闲，可用于“民宿”；</p>

	<p>“三代居”：农忙或者逢年过节时，成年人归来，“民宿”停止。</p>
