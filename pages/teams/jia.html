<h4>House Description</h4>

<div id="eng">
	<p>The topic of our architectural design is Nature•Between. On the one hand, it reflects the intention of creating a naturally friendly sense of living environment, by means of specific/organic building materials, sustainable architectural technology and equipment as well as architectural space that is close to nature. On the other hand, the base is supposed to be at a site in Xiamen’s old urban district. The grandparents are living in the old house part, northern of the site, while the young three-member-family are living in the newly built house. Through special design of the space between the old and new houses, we attempt to create more opportunities for their residents, the older and younger family, to communicate and share, which would enhance the family tie among the three generations. The mending of family gap among generations is also a guiding concept of the design.</p>

	<p>Design highlights:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>100% of the building energy consumption can be covered by solar energy.</li>
		<li>90% of the architectural materials are natural organic such as bamboo, wood and straw.</li>
		<li>Partial 3D modular construction, with the prefabricate components being transported by flat truck and assembled at the construction site.</li>
		<li>Entire intelligent control of architectural equipment, sunshade, skylight and home appliances.</li>
		<li>Create of various natural space among artificial rooms in the form of gardens inside and outside, making connections between human and nature in different ways.</li>
		<li>Pay close attention to the fixing of the gap among the three generations within old or new households from the aspect of spacial design.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>建筑主题为“自然之间”（Nature•Between），一方面旨在通过有机的建筑材料，可持续的建筑技术和设备，以及亲近自然的建筑空间来营造一种自然友好的居住环境。另一方面，该方案基地假设在厦门的一个城中村，爷爷奶奶居住在基地后面的老房子里，新的三口之家居住在新建住宅中。通过新老建筑之间空间的处理，我们试图为三代人创造更多的交往机会，让三代人之间的关系更加融洽。这也是“自然之间”的另一层寓意。</p>

	<p>设计亮点：</p>

	<ul>
		<li>100%建筑能源来自太阳能；</li>
		<li>90%以上的建筑材料为竹、木、秸秆等自然有机的建筑材料；</li>
		<li>工厂预制、平板车运输、施工现场拼装的局部3D模块化建造；</li>
		<li>建筑设备、遮阳、天窗、家电等全部智能控制；</li>
		<li>通过室内、室外庭园，营造人工空间之间多种形式的自然空间，让人与自然之间可以产生多种形式的对话；</li>
		<li>从空间层面关注新旧家庭中三代人之间的交往问题。</li>
