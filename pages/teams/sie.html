	<p>The name of the model “Smart Nest” was inspired by the bird nests which are small but cozy. Most of the bird nests are made of twigs, grasses, feathers and mud. These materials, all from local places, are not only economical but also energy-saving and environmentally friendly. The bird's nest can not only passively adapt to the nature, but also can actively adapt to the environment. Moreover, with only one exit, the level of insulation of the bird nests is highly improved. Hence, more energy is saved. Nature endowed everything with spirituality. It is our best mentor. The concept of our solar house “Smart Nest” is a subtle combination of nature and modern construction.</p>

	<p>With elaborate design, Smart Nest takes full advantage of environmentally friendly and energy-saving materials to improve the heat insulation property of the house. Especially in winter, the heating supply of the house relies solely on clean solar energy. No any other auxiliary energies are needed. Furthermore, the simple, humanized design of Smart Nest sets a cozy, warm and mellow tone. On the other hand, the industrial-looking steel structure design embodies the industrial atmosphere in Northeast and brings out the masculine beauty of the house. The combination of softness and hardness, the inter-promoting and checking relation between Yin and Yang embody the beauty of balance while demonstrating the extensive and profound culture of China.</p>

	<p>With “Family” as its core, Smart Nest helps address the issues of home-based care for the aged, children rearing and decompression of young couples at the same time. With a large target market, the diverse customer base of Smart Nest can be divided into three groups. For customers with high income, we offer private villa customization. For middle-income customers, we simplify the original design and lower the cost to the maximum possible extent with meeting customers’ underlying demands as premise. For the third customer group, reconstructions are carried out on the basis of the original in order to realize zero energy consumption and environmental friendliness. In addition, the long-time stability of our house is proven.</p>

	<p>Taking its name from the nest of nature, with the supplement of modern science and technology, Smart Nest is bound to help us deal with the increasingly serious environmental pollution and bring every family a green and healthy lifestyle!</p>

	<p>Smart Nest这个名字的灵感来源于小鸟窝，虽然鸟窝很小但是无比的温馨。鸟巢的建筑材料是树枝、杂草、羽毛、泥土，这些材料都是就地取材，既经济便宜又节能环保。鸟巢既能被动地顺应自然，又能主动适应环境。鸟巢一般只有一个出口，这大大提升了鸟巢的保温效果，这就意味着鸟巢更加的节能。大自然赋予了万物以灵性，更是我们最好的导师，而我们的太阳能小屋Smart Nest正与这一理念巧妙的相结合。</p>

	<p>Smart Nest运用环保节能的材料，通过精心的设计提升房子的保温性能来降低能耗，通过建筑本身的一体化高效太阳能技术就能解决建筑的所有能源需求，即便是在北方寒冷冬季，也不需要通过任何辅助能源，仅靠绿色的太阳能，就能为房子供暖。Smart Nest里各种绿色简约、节能环保的人性化设计在潜移默化中给人一种舒适、温和、柔美之感，而房子中的各种钢结构的设计，既能体现出东北的工业风，又能体现出房子的阳刚之美。刚柔并济，阴阳相克相生，在给人一种平衡之美的同时又道出了中国文化的博大精深。</p>

	<p>Smart Nest以“家”为核心，同时解决了居家养老、育儿和年轻夫妇休闲减压的问题。我们房子的市场推广范围很广，客户可分为三个等级。对于顶层客户，我们提供可定制私人别墅的服务。对于中间层的客户，我们将简化我们房子原有的设计，在满足客户基础需求的前提下最大可能的减低房子的成本。对于第三层次的客户，我们将会在他们原有的房子上进行改造，从而达到零能耗和保护环境的效果。我们的房子的长时间稳定性已经过实验测试证实。</p>

	<p>智巢，取名于自然之巢，加以人类的科学技术变为智慧之巢，我们坚信我们的绿色太阳能小屋定能解决愈加严重的环境问题，带给每个家庭一个绿色健康的居家生活！</p>
