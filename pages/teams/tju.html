	<p>The EnergyPLUS Home 4.0 is based on not only a one family house, but the concept to fit a unit of an apartment building for the Chinese market status quo. We designed the floorplans closed on west and east sides, and opened on north and south sides, to remain the prototype the possibility to join several homes into one amalgamated dwelling. However, the one we are going to show on site would be a single unit for a family with two parents and 1-2 children as an example.</p>

	<p>Beyond the north and south facades which already have perfect thermal performance, there are two buffer zones added to make the home perform better both technically and architecturally. The zones could act as climate buffer layers in cold winter and even winter gardens when there is comfortable sunshine. In summer, the windows could be open, and then ceilings on south buffer zone turn to be sun-shading panels. In transfer seasons, people could directly go out and sitting, reading, or enjoying their coffee on the balconies, then the zones would be additional space just to enlarge the room area.</p>

	<p>Besides the buffer zones which could be built on site, the main part structure would be made of 12 prefabricated steel boxes, let the function even more flexible and the whole construction process more sustainable. Please feel free to explore the pleasant, integral, and modular space on the two floors.</p>

	<p>正能量房4.0的概念不仅仅是一座独栋小屋，也考虑了中国市场现状，具备成为公寓楼中一户单元的可能。我们将东西两侧设计为封闭，南北两侧开敞，使得这一原型保留横向拼接的潜能。竞赛期间我们将会建造一幢适合双亲和1-2位孩子的家庭住宅作为示例。</p>

	<p>除了本身具备极佳热工性能的南北立面，我们加设了两个缓冲区来提高技术和建筑性能。寒冷的冬季，它们成为气候缓冲层，若在晴天，还可成为阳光房。夏季缓冲区打开，天花板则成为遮阳构件。过渡季节人们是可以直接进入缓冲区的，坐到阳台上，阅读，喝咖啡，就像房间本身扩大了一样。</p>

	<p>除了可以现场建造的缓冲区，建筑主体结构会由12个预制钢盒子组成，让功能更加灵活，建造过程更可持续。请尽情在这两个楼层中，探索宜人、整体、模数化的空间吧。</p>
