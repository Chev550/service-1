	<p><strong>Design Background</strong></p>

	<p>New generation has great housing demands and pursues new living style. However so many high-rise buildings can be found in most modern cities in order to satisfy the largest plot ratio, which has disrupted the living environment and done harm to harmonious neighborhood relationship. The consequences of it lead to tedious and indifferent living pattern which is contradictory to the demands of younger generation for high living quality.</p>

	<p><strong>Initial Inspiration</strong></p>

	<p>Conventional long and narrow residences which are popular in low-level but high density communities have advantages of accommodating mass of population and providing sufficient space for social communication, Thus they exist in many regions worldwide and bring vigor to such districts, such as bamboo house and tubular housing.</p>

	<p><strong>Design Concept</strong></p>

	<p>Team SCUT-POLITO aims to build a new model of long and narrow house “LONG PLAN” on the base of improving the living environment of old style long and narrow residence. On account of the concept of “serving” and “being served”, LONG PLAN proposes feasible and rational space partition leads in the idea of “integration”, which can closely combine serving facilities and assisting space to achieve a more comfortable and flexible free space.</p>

	<p><strong>Aim Orientation</strong></p>

	<p>LONG PLAN locates in young groups of new era such as makers, artists and designers who have creativity and action capability and constructs a dynamic and communal community from three aspects of energy, production and living, which will advocate the practice of the concept of “environmental protection”, “intelligent creation” and “sharing” to the new style of urban housing for young people.</p>

	<p><strong>设计背景</strong></p>

	<p>现代青年人具有巨大的住房需求，并追求新型的生活模式。然而现代城市为追求高容积率，盲目建造高层住宅，破坏了过去的居住环境和融洽的邻里关系，和造成生活模式单调冷漠，难以满足青年群体日益增长的居住生活质量需求。</p>

	<p><strong>灵感来源</strong></p>

	<p>传统的狭长式住宅，能形成低层高密度的社区，具有容纳大量人口活动和激化街区活力的优势，并在全世界范围内大量存在和更新，如竹筒屋、管式住宅等。</p>

	<p><strong>设计概念</strong></p>

	<p>Team SCUT-POLITO旨在改善原有狭长式住宅的居住环境基础上，建造一种新型的狭长型住宅LONG PLAN。基于“服务”和“被服务”空间的理性划分，LONG PLAN引入了“集成体”概念，将服务性设施与辅助性空间高度集成，以获得更为舒适的居住环境和灵活自由的空间功能。</p>

	<p><strong>目标定位</strong></p>

	<p>LONG PLAN定位于创客、艺术家、设计师等富有创造力与行动能力的新时代青年群体，从能源、生产、生活三个方面营造一个极具活力的青年集合共享社区，将“环保”、“智造”、“共享”的城市新型住宅模式在青年群体中力行实践。</p>
