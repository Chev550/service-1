	<p>Qiju 2.0 is based on the traditional Chinese living pattern, three generations with one roof, meeting the needs of most families in China. The house includes three bedrooms, two halls, two bathrooms and a kitchen. The building area is of 156 m2. Considering the “people, life and technology” together is one of our important design philosophies, to create a comfortable, economic, green, and healthy home.</p>

	<p>Space: The design combines climate conditions in Dezhou with traditional Chinese spatial characteristics. The outdoor landscape garden in the south side uses the collection of rainwater. The passive solar space at entrance to provide winter heating. Bedrooms and living room are distributed in the south side of the building to obtain good sunshine. Kitchen, bathroom and other auxiliary spaces are distributed in the north side of the house to block the north wind. Using the loft space as a workplace and other secondary space, to improve spatial experiences. There is a full consideration of natural ventilation and natural lighting in the house to provide a comfortable and energy saving environment.</p>

	<p>Structure and materials: The main structure employs the "wood lattice" load-bearing system. The materials, which are decreasing the cost and easy to be produced, can be found in market easily. Lattice wall cavity space can be filled with heat storage, insulations and other materials. It can also be used as a storage room to enhance the space efficiency. The main construction is consisted of steel, glued wood, wood and other green materials which are low carbon, recyclable and easily degradable.</p>

	<p>Green technology: integrating the market equipment; emphasizing the application of cost-effective technology; focusing on the integration of green technology and building space which shall get a great development. The use of photovoltaic power generation is to provide energy. The use of passive design is for energy storage. Collection and treatment of domestic sewage and rainwater is used for the courtyard landscape. There will be a full use of efficient LED lighting. The intelligent system for the whole building leads more energy efficient and humane.</p>
