	<p>Beyond the technical aspects of construction, design development fundamentally addresses functional issues of living a modestly sized home: What do people essentially need for a satisfying lifestyle, despite limited income and space? How can we best apply ergonomic principles in an aesthetically desirable manner? What are the differences in needs for different occupant groups? For student participants coming from different fields of study, the project affords a unique opportunity to explore building design methods across disciplines in an integrative context that spans the entirety of the design process, from preliminary concept to full-scale prototyping and testing.</p> 

	<p>All the materials used in the construction system must be carefully selected for their combined impact on the building’s indoor air quality, dynamic thermal properties, and environmental footprint over the entire component lifecycle. Through our connections with Chinese manufacturing companies, we have excellent access to new technologies, exemplary products, and advanced systems for potential implementation in the prototype. These products and systems include engineered timber components, alternative insulation materials, integrated roofing and photovoltaic systems, high-performance windows, PCM’s, lighting and building control systems, energy-efficient household appliances, as well as ecologically designed furniture.</p>

	<p>Our architectural aims are tightly aligned with what we consider to be the “unique selling points” of the prototype in terms of market appeal as a concept. More specially, the concrete prototype targets both single and coupled individuals who are looking to live in a house of modest size, in other words, it targets a currently very large and rapidly growing sector of the housing market around the world. The prototype is built of lightweight, wood-based construction components that can be assembled in various combinations as needed. We will provide a manual of model variations to demonstrate the concept’s potential range of applications for potential residents so that they can see how to apply it to meet their individual needs and desire.</p>

	<p>除了技术方面的建设，设计开发从根本上解决了一个中等大小的家庭的居住的问题：人们需要什么来实现一个满意的生活方式，除去有限的收入和空间？我们怎样才能最好地应用人机工程学原理来完善我们的审美理想？不同群体的需求有什么不同？对于来自不同领域的学生，该项目提供了一个机会，探索建筑设计方法跨学科的综合背景，从初步的概念、全面的原型设计和测试，跨越了整个的设计过程。</p>

	<p>在建筑系统中使用的所有材料必须仔细选择他们的组合对建筑物的室内空气质量、动态热性能和环境的影响，对整个组件生命周期的影响。通过我们与中国制造业公司的合作，我们有很好的访问新技术、示范性产品和先进的系统。这些产品和系统，包括工程木构件、选择保温材料，屋面光伏系统集成，高性能的Windows，PCM、照明、楼宇控制系统、高效节能的家用电器，以及生态设计的家具。</p>

	<p>我们的建筑目标与我们认为是市场吸引力作为概念的原型的“独特卖点”紧密一致。更具体地，具体的原型针对单身和耦合的个人，他们正在寻找住在一个适度的房子，换句话说，它瞄准了一个目前非常大和快速增长的房地产市场的世界。原型由轻质的，基于木材的建筑构件构成，可根据需要以各种组合进行组装。我们将提供一个模型变化手册，以展示该概念对潜在居民的潜在应用范围，以便他们了解如何应用它以满足他们的个人需求和愿望。</p>
