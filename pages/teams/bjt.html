	<p>Environmental issues and aging problems bring us inspirations in this i-Yard 2.0 design. Escaping from cities and diving into the charming countryside, which exactly our concept is, can be a dream of so many senior citizens in China. Based on renewable energy like solar power, we create safe, comfortable and intelligent home for them when immersed in fresh air and fascinating scenery.</p>

	<p>Multiple dimensions yards penetrate into the house, all essential living spaces are located in the first floor. Considering the desire to a convenient and comfortable life, we come up with the idea of "moving back line" that the moving routine is no need of backward.</p>

	<p>Platforms and temporary spaces are on the second floor, which can satisfy demands such as entertainment and visiting from younger generation.</p>

	<p>The "Green Core" provides seasonal scenery as well as passive strategies, for instance of ventilation and sunshine.</p>

	<p>Having rest, doing exercise and plantation in the embrace of yard surrounded by steel-bamboo structure, isn't it the future our parents always dream about?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Industrialization is the design foundation. So we choose prefabricated module, which is beneficial to market promotion, to pursue the advantages in transport, fast construction and energy conservation.</li>
		<li>Customization is the design core. We pour love and care to optimize our design for different individuals. A variety of energy solutions including ecological yard is also taken into consideration.</li>
		<li>Intelligence is the design highlight. Less is more. So we are going to present advanced energy saving technology in the simplest way to show the real meaning of smart life.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Family with independent house and yard.</p>

	<p>This future is coming soon.</p>

	<p>i-Yard 2.0的设计灵感来源于TEAM BJTU对中国当下的环境恶化和老龄化社会问题的关注和思考，我们提出“新城镇养老社区”的概念，让退休老人远离城市，回到风景优美鸡犬相闻的乡村生活中去，让他们在呼吸新鲜空气、体味田园时光的同时，享受我们为其精心设计的以太阳能等可再生能源利用为基础的舒适、安全、健康的智能家居环境。</p>

	<p>i-Yard2.0是一栋包含多重庭院的两层住宅，一层满足老人生活所需的全部空间，并加入“回游动线”的设计要素，全方位考虑老年生活的便利与舒适，二层加入屋顶平台和临时空间，用以满足子女居住和全家休闲娱乐的需求。住宅内部包裹玻璃绿核，为房子提供四季变换的景观和日照、通风、空气净化等被动式策略。</p>

	<p>住宅外部以竹钢结构围合环绕建筑的主题庭院，种植、休憩、运动均能满足，一年四季，移步易景，十分惬意。</p>

	<ul>
		<li>“工业化”是设计的基础，预制装配式模块便于运输和快速搭建，经济节能，利于养老社区的普及和推广。</li>
		<li>“定制化”是设计的核心，针对不同的老人，提供最具关怀的精细化设计和多种能源解决方案，引入绿色庭院，打造田园生态住宅。</li>
		<li>“智慧化”是设计的亮点，结合高效节能的现代科技手段，让老人在宜人的环境里，用最简单的方式，度过最幸福的晚年生活。</li>
	</ul>

	<p>一人一屋，一宅一院，邻里相伴，颐养天年。</p>
