	<p>DOTTIE is an abbreviation of Digitally, Operated, Tectonic, Integrated and Environment. They were five systems of this design.</p>

	<p>The target population of this design are four generations of family, aims to building the solar-saving House – “Enclosing Harmonious House” that use five systems and combine a modern approach and traditional Chinese dwellings to let multi-generational live together in harmony, and harmony between human beings and nature.</p>

	<p>At the center of the house is a collective space named “memory room” where all family meet and interact with each other. The central space is wrapped by an inclusive wall layer that is surrounded by special moments though the inner layer that brings various activities into the central space. From this central space, inhabitants can view special framed moments that circulate around the center, bringing a colorful palette of activity and event within the home.</p>

	<p>The memory wall stores and displays objects of memory within the central space, symbolizing the harmony between the four generations. Whether it is a family portrait, an heirloom, or a precious toy, the memory wall displays these symbols within the central space, representing the complex identity of a multi-generational home. It is the ultimate symbol of unity within a multi-generational home: tradition recognized in remembrance, the new alongside the old, and the individual within the collective. These elements visually symbolize the colorful relationship between the four generations.</p>

	<p>Framing the various programs surrounding the central space are nooks and openings, which vary in size, shape, and function. The nooks frame important objects of different scales within the house, ranging from the smallest of family portraits to the kitchen, which services and provides for the entire family. Visible from the center collective space, the nooks incorporate playfulness, structure, and flexibility along the surrounding programs and the memory wall.</p>

	<p>In order to make the house passive, our design pays close attention to low energy consumption, building orientation, window openings and placement, and reusing greywater for building reuse and irrigation. Building integrated solar panels to help decrease the amount of energy being used from the grid and decrease the environmental impact generated by using non-reusable energy sources. Furthermore, by making our design modular, this energy efficient house can be easily built anywhere in the world.</p>

	<p>DOTTIE为英文释义为数字化、操作化、构造化、集成化和生态化，是本设计的五大系统。</p>

	<p>本设计的目标人群是四代同堂式家庭，目的是利用五大系统，结合中国传统四合院及现代化技术，营造促进多代人和睦相处，人与自然和谐共生的太阳能式节能住宅——“合·和”居。</p>

	<p>“合”代表空间围合，“和”代表家庭和美，人与自然和谐共生。</p>

	<p>住宅中央是为“回忆屋”，家人可在此聚餐、交流、娱乐，它由四周的“回忆墙”所围合。墙上的纪念物、家人合影等，体现了多代家庭的多样性。同时，这些的纪念物被视为多代家庭和美生活的象征，展现四代人间的有趣关系。</p>

	<p>为了建造被动式节能住宅，本设计密切关注能耗、建筑与环境、水的再利用等问题。身为模块化集成建筑，它可被容易地建在世界各地。</p>
