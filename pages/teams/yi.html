	<p>For the consideration of the solar house design, we are determined to pursue a model that combining localization, traditional and modern technology, to explore the new “regional eco-houses”. During the long course of history, the traditional architectural culture embodies the living wisdom of Chinese people thousands of years, which can work with modern ecological concepts perfectly, and we are trying to attempt it in this program.</p>

	<p><strong>Geomancy distribution and ecology integration</strong></p>

	<p>Geomancy is an applied art which elaborates relationship between human and natural ecology. Orientation distribution and environment model is stressed in geomancy. In the concept of modern ecological residential planning, reasonable regulation of microclimate which is in the geomancy can create a comfortable living environment. In the overall layout, building, semi-outer space and outdoor environment are overall planned reasonably. At the same time, the eastern side of the base is covered mostly by shrub vegetation, in order to reduce heat radiation in summer and increase the oxygen content in the base. The four parts are interspersed with each other to form a good ecological organism according to the geomancy.</p>

	<p><strong>The traditional form and layout</strong></p>

	<p>In Chinese traditional architecture, the courtyard is a unique architectural form, we also try starting from the courtyard layout, to form the advantages of traditional architectural innovation, using modern techniques and living mode into the new building form, to create Chinese in line with the new residential model and experience. The overall plan of the building is enclosed courtyard mode, inheriting the Chinese traditional residential "four water return hall" space characteristics Atrium natural landscape, and the eastern side of the body to open, the external landscape and the atrium scene echoed. On the north side of the main building is divided into two layers, one layer is formed on the south side of the entrance, the north south high low China traditional architectural form characteristics.</p>

	<p><strong>Building Function and Ecological Node</strong></p>

	<p>The second floor of the north side and the first floor of the south, which are combined as a single slope roof, to maximize the area required providing solar panels; architectural function of the body is a simple "L" type Reduce the building of the form factor, reduce heat consumption. The equipment space is set on the west side of the floor. The west side gable and the north side wall, in the case of meeting the ventilation requirements, to maximize the reduction of the window area. In places where there are regular activities or open space, such as porch, corridor, outdoor tea room and other locations were set up shade blinds and awning, in order to achieve the purpose of shading the radiation.</p>

	<p>在本方案的思考中，我们立志追求一种对本土化，传统化与现代技术结合的一种模式，探讨一种全新的“地域化生态住宅”。中国历史悠久，传统建筑文化中有很多凝聚着中华民族千百年来的居住智慧，并可以与现代生态理念相得益彰的基因，我们试图在本方案中初步尝试。</p>

	<p><strong>1. 风水布局与生态整合</strong></p>

	<p>风水学是一种阐述人和自然生态关系的一门应用艺术。在风水中强调了方位布局与环境模式，在现在生态住宅规划理念中，借助风水之理念对微气候的合理调节可以很好的达到宜居的居住环境。在整体布局中，将建筑部分，半室外空间与室外环境进行合理的统筹与规划。这四部分依据风水学布局的主体互相穿插，形成很好的生态有机体。</p>

	<p><strong>2. 传统形态与平面布局</strong></p>

	<p>中国传统建筑中，合院是一个特有的民居形态，我们也尝试从合院的布局出发，力图将传统建筑的形态优势加以创新，用现代手法与起居模式融入到新建筑形体中，以创造符合新中国居住模式与体验方式。建筑整体平面呈围合式天井院的模式，继承中国传统住宅“四水归堂”的空间特点。中庭设置自然景观，并将东侧形体打开，将外部景观与中庭景互相呼应。建筑北侧主体为两层，南侧玄关为一层，形成良好的北高南低的中国传统建筑形体特点。</p>

	<p><strong>3. 建筑功能与生态节点</strong></p>

	<p>建筑北侧二层南侧一层，并形成一个整体的单坡式屋顶，最大化的提供太阳能板所需的面积；建筑功能形体为一简洁的“L”型，最大化的降低建筑的形体系数，降低热消耗。设备空间设置在一层西侧的位置。在居住着经常活动或休憩的地方，如门廊、走廊、室外茶室等位置分别设置了遮阳百叶与遮阳棚，以达到遮阳防辐射的目的。</p>
